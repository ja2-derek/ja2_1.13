***********************
** Bugfixes: ja2.exe **
***********************

- !! IMPORTANT: The current ja2.exe is a Release Build with additional Debug informations, which is very useful for the developers. I hope this does not decrease performance! !!
- NCTH: Fixed projection factor so NCTH cursor displays the actual projection factor a shot will include. This also corrects the shooting aperture so it includes the laser bonus correctly
- NCTH: Split the NCTH "gravity" into two external values: GRAVITY_COEFFECIENT controls how rapidly bullets fall once we pass max range and RANGE_COEFFECIENT is applied against a weapons range value to determine max range.
- NCTH: Updated some of the scope related functions to properly use the trait bonuses for determining scope effective ranges
- NCTH: Remove the "confirm" click that is currently required to take an autofire shot
- NCTH: Corrected problems with the NCTH Recoil code
- NCTH: Fixed "bug" that results from shooting at a target who's facing is perpendicular to the shooters

- Removed erroneous AttachmentSystem tags from various items in Items.xml. The only items that should be set to AttachmentSystem=1 are items that are not valid in NAS but things like knives, grenades, canteens and first aid kits all seemed to have been listed as "OAS-only". This should resolve that.
