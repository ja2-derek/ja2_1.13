++ Editing missions and descriptions edt files ++

All texts are contained in files "mission(number).edt" in the folder "BriefingRoom\edt\". 
Example : Mission0.edt. 0 - uindex from the file Tabledata\BriefingRoom\BriefingRoom.xml

We add pictures to the folder "BriefingRoom". The name consists of "missionX_Y.sti". X - uiIndex from "Tabledata\BriefingRoom\BriefingRoom.xml". Y - the number of picture.
Example : Mission0_0.edt, Mission0_1.edt...Mission0_20.edt

The name of the sound file consists of "MissionX.wav". X - uiIndex from "Tabledata\BriefingRoom\BriefingRoom.xml".

The file "descriptionXXX.edt" contains the descriptions of displayed pictures. Every record is the separate description for picture. Record 0 is for picture 
mission0_0.sti, record 1 for picture mission0_1.sti... XXX - uiIndex from "Tabledata\BriefingRoom\BriefingRoom.xml".
