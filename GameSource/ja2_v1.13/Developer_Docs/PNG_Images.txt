To enable it you must set USE_PNG_ITEM_IMAGES to true in [Ja2 Settings] in ja2.ini (default value is false). 
Of course the png images must exist first. To create them you can use the Ja2convert.exe program. 
You can build it with Visual Studio. It is included in the ja2 solution.

The call 

  	ja2convert sti Data-1.13\Interface\MDGUNS.sti Data-1.13\Interface

creates a 7z archive with png images. You have to extract these files to 

Interface\MDGUNS for MDGUNS.jpc.7z, 
Interface\MDP1ITEMS for MDP1ITEMS.jpc.7z
Interface\MDP2ITEMS for MDP2ITEMS.jpc.7z
Interface\MDP3ITEMS for MDP3ITEMS.jpc.7z

There is no restriction to the number of files in these directories. 
But for every item in Items.xml (ubGraphicNum) there should be a png image with this number as filename (eg. 023.png). 
If the image does not exist, the game throws an exception when that item is used (not earlier).
